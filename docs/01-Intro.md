# Introduction {#Intro1}



## Project Title

Engaging a transboundary expert network to prioritize coastal and marine habitat management for sea ducks in the Salish Sea.

## Project Summary {#Intro1.1}

Sea ducks constitute a marine bird vital sign indicator of ecosystem health in the Salish Sea, which is of global importance to many populations of marine birds that use different parts of the ecosystem through the course of each annual cycle. It is imperative to work across management jurisdictions to effectively conserve or recover key areas of habitat for these birds. However, the jurisdictional complexity presents a major challenge to taking an ecosystem scale approach to the problem, not least because many information sources (i.e., biological datasets) end at the international border. This work aims to overcome this barrier by harmonizing information in a way that assists the agencies responsible for implementing conservation prescriptions, especially in terms of key habitats.

## Guide Goals {#Intro1.2}

This R users guide aims to fulfill one of the key project initiatives: to identify and assess compatibility of avian datasets in the Salish Sea. By the end of this guide, researchers or resources managers interesting in accessing and compiling the available data resources will know:

(1) Which transboundary data resources are available
(2) Who the data owners are and how to access the data with appropriate permissions
(3) How the datasets are structured, including details on the data collection protocols
(4) What the limitations, challenges, and opportunities are associates with each datasets
(5) How to compile the datasets into a standardize data format


> **WARNING: This guide may not provide all the details needed for the specific analysis you are interested in doing. Data users are responsible for understanding the data collection protocols before proceeding. If in doubt, reach out to the data owner with your questions.**

## Guide Structure

Each chapter in this guide is dedicated to a dataset and is structure using similar subheadings. The datasets are presented in the following order: Canadian, U.S., transboundary. A final chapter is dedicated to modelling frameworks and approaches.

## Acknowledgements {#Intro1.3}

A great deal of time and effort have gone into gathering, compiling, and making the data presented in this guide accessible. Appropriate acknowledgement of the source of the information is required, including acknowledgement of volunteer efforts in instances where data were collected by citizen scientist.
