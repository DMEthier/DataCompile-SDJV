It is imperative to work across management jurisdictions to effectively conserve or recover key areas of habitat for these birds. However, the jurisdictional complexity presents a major challenge to taking an ecosystem scale approach to the problem, not least because many information sources (i.e., biological datasets) end at the international border. This work aims to overcome this barrier by harmonizing information in a way that assists the agencies responsible for implementing conservation prescriptions, especially in terms of key habitats. 1.3 Guide Goals This R users guide aims to fulfill one of the key project initiatives: to identify and assess compatibility of avian datasets in the Salish Sea. By the end of this guide, researchers or resources managers interesting in accessing and compiling the available data resources will know: Which transboundary data resources are available Who the data owners are and how to access the data with appropriate permissions How the datasets are structured, including details on the data collection protocols What the limitations, challenges, and opportunities are associates with each datasets How to compile the datasets into a standardize data format WARNING: This guide may not provide all the details needed for the specific analysis you are interested in doing. Data users are responsible for understanding the data collection protocols before proceeding. If in doubt, reach out to the data owner with your questions. 1.4 Guide Structure Each chapter in this guide is dedicated to a dataset and is structure using similar subheadings. The datasets are presented in the following order: Canadian, U.S., transboundary. A final chapter is dedicated to modelling frameworks and approaches. 1.5 Acknowledgements A great deal of time and effort have gone into gathering, compiling, and making the data presented in this guide accessible. Appropriate acknowledgement of the source of the information is required, including acknowledgement of volunteer efforts in instances where data were collected by citizen scientist. This project was a collaborative initiative between Birds Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Ducks Unlimited Canada, Pacific Habitat Join Venture, USGS Cooperative Unit, Washing Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Audubon Washington.

In short, surveys have been conducted by volunteers using a standardized protocol and data collection sheets. Shore-based counts are completed monthly on or near the second Sunday of each month from September to April. Surveys are complete within approximately 2 hour of high tide to maximize the opportunity for close observation. All waterbirds observed to a distance of 1 km from the high tide line are counted, except those that fly through without stopping. In the case of larger flocks, numbers are estimated by counting individuals and species in groups and scaling up (see Training Module for Volunteers). Data are entered through a customized online data entry system available on the Birds Canada website, NatureCounts. Observations are processed using the eBird data filters to flag rare species and high counts during observer data entry, and records are manually reviewed for form accuracy. 2.3 Avian Data Collected Observation counts of waterbird and raptor species seen during a survey are compiled at the scale of the route (i.e., the maximum count per species) on each monthly survey. These observations are divided into inland, near shore (shoreline to 500m out from high tide), off shore (beyond 500m), and total counts. The dataset is not zero-filled. Taxonomic Authority = eBird/Clements v2019 2.4 Auxiliary Data Collected Observer information: observer ID Survey Information: time observation started, time observation ended, duration in hours Survey Condition: precipitation, % cloud, sea condition, tide state, tide movement, visibility, survey equipment, human activity (all categorical) 2.5 Data Access, Permission, and Format Data can be freely accessed through the NatureCounts data download portal or directly through the naturecounts R package, which I will demonstrate later in this chapter. The BCCWS is Access Level 4 dataset, meaning a data request form must be submitted to get access. This is not meant to be a barrier, just a means of keeping track of who is using the data and for what purposes. Data are formatted using a standardized schema that is a core standard of the Avian Knowledge Network and which feeds into GBIF.This format is called the Bird Monitoring Data Exchange (BMDE), which includes 169 core fields used for capturing all metric and descriptors associated with bird observations. 2.6 Data Use Considerations The data are collected using a standardize protocol, by trained citizen-science volunteers. This standardization is a strength of this datasets for making inferences about coastal waterbirds in the Canadian Salish Sea. The repeated sampling design of the BCCWS makes this dataset suitable for an occupancy modelling framework, in which the probability of detection can be modeled alongside occupancy. Auxiliary data collected during each survey are suitable for the detection process of the model. Using mean counts in abundance on a route within a year, these data have also been recently used to assess coastal waterbird trends. Measures of effort are innate to the dataset. Survey duration (column DurationinHours) and survey area can be used to make effort correction to counts. Survey areas for each survey route has been provided as a .shp file in the Data folder in this project directory. The number of years an observer has been doing the survey can also be used to correct for observer bias. There is spatial inbalance in the sampling design, with more routes occurring in the southern Salish Sea and around areas that are inhabited by people. Hard to access locations are no well sampled, nor are regions further to the north. Since this survey is shore-based, there will be a species sampling bias. Specifically, birds that use near shore habitats will be detected and counted more often than birds which use offshore habitats. This dataset may therefore be less suitable for modelling at-sea habitat use, for example. The dataset should be filtered prior to use. For example, rare species should be removed since they are not necessarily representative (e.g., those which occur on &lt;1% of routes). Depending on the analysis, routes that are run for only a short time (e.g., &lt;3 years) or which have incomplete data (e.g., &lt;8 months per year or &lt;4 core winter month) may be considered for removal.This dataframe is NOT zero-filled. It is up to the data user to zero-fill th martix prior to use. 2.7 Data Processing Some basic R scripts are provided for importing and compiling the BCCWS data. How you process a dataset will largely depending on the research question you are asking and the analytical approach you are taking. These scripts are therefore not suitable for all data processing needs. If you are new to the naturecounts R package, I recommend you start by reviewing the Introductory R Tutorial.

Also note that the year long survey period straddles a calendar year. In short, counts of birds and marine mammals were made from boat moving at 10-12 knots within a 200 m (100m on either side) wide transect parallel to the shoreline. Surveyors also recorded the number of birds and mammals seen beyond 100 m of the boat. Two observers scanned for birds and mammals on either side of the boat. One observer calls out waypoints approximately every 250-500 meters (depending on survey year), while the other observer recorded the data. Binoculars are used to assist in counting and identifying distant birds and mammals. In most situations, birds and mammals are counted individually. Flocks of more than about 100 individual birds were estimated by summing the number by groups of 10s of individuals. Technical reports can be found here: The Southern Gulf Islands (2008-2010) Burrard Inlet and Indian Arm (2011-2013) Boundary Bay (2007-2008) (no report available) Howe Sound (2014-2015) The Fraser River Estuary (2016-2017) 3.3 Avian Data Collected Counts of waterbird seen during a survey are compiled at the scale of the point along a survey transect (i.e., the maximum count per species) on each monthly survey.

In short, surveys have been conducted by volunteers using a standardized protocol and data collection sheets. Shore-based counts are completed monthly on the first Saturday of each month from October to April. Surveys are complete within approximately 2 hour of high tide to maximize the opportunity for close observation. Surveys are a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes per site. All waterbirds observed to a distance of 300 m from the high tide line are counted, except those that fly through without stopping. For large flocks, surveys estimate both the min, max, and best estimate. Surveyors are required to attend a short training session with the Seattle Audubon staff prior to their first survey. Data are entered through a customized online data entry system available here. 5.3 Avian Data Collected Total observation counts of each waterbird species seen during a point survey are recorded for each monthly, including bearing, distance, and sex ratio. Raptor number and species are recorded separately from the other waterbird species. The dataset is not zero-filled. Taxonomic Authority = 5.4 Auxiliary Data Collected Observer information: observer name Survey Information: time observation started, time observation ended Survey Condition: weather, precipitation, sea state, tide movement, visibility, human activity, raptor activity (all categorical) 5.5 Data Access, Permission, and Format At the time of writing, the data were only accessible by reaching out to the Seattle Audubon directly and filling out a data share agreement. The data will be sent as a .xslx flat file which will be suitable for processing. 5.6 Data Use Considerations The data are collected using a standardize protocol, by trained citizen-science volunteers. This standardization is a strength of this datasets for making inferences about coastal waterbirds in the US Salish Sea. Since surveyors gathers information on distance and direction, estimates of bird density through distance sampling is possible. Specifically, detection of any species declines with the distance from the observer: poor sighting conditions, quality of observing equipment, and observer inexperience all contribute to declining detection likelihood as distance increases. Distance sampling provides a robust approach to estimating density and allow for calculation of less biased density estimates. The repeated sampling design of the PSSS makes this dataset suitable for an occupancy modelling framework, in which the probability of detection can be modeled alongside occupancy. Auxiliary data collected during each survey are suitable for the detection process of the model. Measures of effort are innate to the dataset. Survey duration can be used to make effort correction to counts. There is spatial inbalance in the sampling design? Since this survey is shore-based, there will be a species sampling bias. Specifically, birds that use near shore habitats will be detected and counted more often than birds which use offshore habitats. This dataset may therefore be less suitable for modelling sea bird habitat use, for example.

The surveys were designed to occur during midwinter, when sea ducks and other marine birds are least likely to be migrating. Flights are conducted at an altitude of 200 feet (61 meters) above the water and at an airspeed of 85-90 knots. Each biologist counts all marine bird and mammal observations within a 50-meter strip along their respective side of the aircraft. The surveys cover the entire shoreline of the inland marine waters of Washington. The offshore waters are sampled by flying a pre-designed zigzag pattern. MASS data processing notes can be found online by navigating to the ESRI open data portal. Download the data by clicking the Open button, then save the files to the Data directory in this project. Information on data processing can be found in the Midwinter Aerial Seabird Surveys Geoprocessing Metadata Notes.pdf. In short, during pre-processing the flight crew transcribe voice recordings of their observations, linking them with a series of GPS observation point locations collected during the survey. The results are two tab-delimited text files containing observation and track-log locations. When the surveyors have completed their transcription, a series of geoprocessing scripts are run which omit off-effort observations, calculate the extent of surveyed areas, and add appropriate attribute information to both observations and survey strips. 6.3 Avian Data Collected The PSEMP_Survey_Observations layer stores the processed bird observation data, including total ObservationCount of species on a given transect. Taxonomic Authority - TaxoNameID of unknown authority There are three additional table which are used to assign species to species codes, scientific names, and groups. Species This table lists the avian species groups recorded during the winter fixed-wing aerial shorebird surveys. It provides species common and scientific names as well as the species codes (TaxoNameID) necessary to crosswalk these species to group membership (for composite groups analyzed) and to other WDFW databases. PSEMP_Group This table provides a list of composite groups of species surveys. Some of these groups were included in subsequent statistical analysis; these groups are noted in the “StatsRun” attribute. SpeciesPSEMP_Group This associative table allows species observations to be crosswalked to composite groups that they participate in. 6.4 Auxiliary Data Collected Each point observation contains detailed attribute information including date, time, TransectID, ObserverID, and environmental characteristics (i.e., wind, glare). The MidwinterAerialSeaBirdSurvey.gdb also contains a PSEMP_Analysis_Strata polygon file that contains the spatial extent and boundaries of the basin-depth strata. There are nine basins and six depth classes identified. 6.5 Data Access, Permission, and Format Data are accessible online by navigating to the ESRI open data portal. Download the data by clicking the Open button, then save the files to the Data directory in this project. The data are saved as a geodatabase (.gdb) and can be open in ArcGIS, QGIS, or in R, depending on your comfort with these different programs.

All birds heard or seen during a specified time at a specific location are recorded. There are three main data collection protocol, including: Stationary - objective was birding, a single fixed location, with specified start and end time Travelling - objective was birding, specified start and end time, and known distance of travel Incidental - objctive was not on birding, but species was identified and submitted. Not a complete checklist.

Detection rates from banding are very different from normal birding Nocturnal Flight Call (NFC) - nighttime contact calls of migrating songbirds as they pass through on their way to breeding grounds 7.3 Avian Data Collected eBird data are collected and organized around the concept of a checklist, representing observations from a single birding event, such as a 1 km walk through a park or 15 minutes observing bird feeders in a backyard.

For all downloads and APIs, eBird require first that you submit a request with a short abstract so they can learn more about how eBird data are being used. eBird date requests can be made to Cornell here. There is also an option to request eBird Canada data through the NatureCounts platform by making a request here. However, for the purposes of this transboundary project, the data example will be using eBird data accessed through Cornell. eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) is the core dataset for accessing all raw eBird observations and associated metadata.There are several R packages available for summarizing data, including one that is managed by the Cornell Lab specifically for working with the EBD dataset. auk: eBird Data Extraction and Processing with AWK. eBird Observational Dataset (EOD) is made available through GBIF and includes species, date, and location. Additional metadata associated with these observations, including sampling event data (such as effort), are not included through this data access platform. eBird’s Terms of Use are clearly outlined on their webpage, and should be reviewed prior to accessing data. eBird data are not zero-filled. Instructions on zero-filling the dataset can be found here. 7.6 Data Use Considerations eBird is a semi-structured project, having flexible, easy to follow protocols that attract many participants, making it the largest avian citizen science dataset globally. However, despite the strengths of eBird’s size, species observations collected through citizen science projects present a number of challenges that are not found in conventional scientific data. The following are some of the primary challenges associated these data: taxonomic, spatial, and temporal biases, spatial precision, class inbalance, and variation in detection. When working with semi-structured datasets like eBird, one approach to dealing with this variation is to impose some more consistent structure on the data by filtering observations on the effort variables. This reduces the variation in detectability between checklists. It is generally recommended that users restricting checklists to less than 5 hours long and 5 km in length, and with 10 or fewer observers. Users of eBird data should review and adopt Best Practices for Using eBird Data. 7.7 Data Processing .
