It is therefore imperative to work across management jurisdictions to effectively conserve key areas of habitat for these birds. However, jurisdictional complexities often presents a major challenge to taking an ecosystem scale approach to sea duck management, not least because many information sources (i.e., biological datasets) end at the international border. This work aims to overcome this barrier by harmonizing information in a way that assists agencies responsible for implementing conservation prescriptions. 1.2 Goals This R user guide aims to fulfill one of the key project initiatives: to identify and assess compatibility of avian datasets in the Salish Sea. By the end of this guide, researchers or resources managers interesting in accessing and compiling the available data resources will know: Which transboundary data resources are available Who the data owners are and how to access the data with appropriate permissions How the datasets are structured, including details on the data collection protocols What the limitations, challenges, and opportunities are associated with each dataset How to compile the datasets into a standardized data format WARNING: This guide may not provide all the details needed for the specific analysis you are interested in doing. Data users are responsible for understanding the data collection protocols before proceeding. If in doubt, reach out to the data owner with your questions! 1.3 Guide Structure Chapters 2-8 in this guide are dedicated to detailing each dataset separately, and are structure using similar subheadings. The datasets are presented in the following order: Canada, U.S., transboundary. Chapter 9 focuses on compiling the data sources into a standardized framework. Chapter 10 is dedicated to modelling frameworks and approaches. 1.4 Acknowledgements A great deal of time and effort have gone into gathering, compiling, and making the data presented in this guide accessible. Data users need to appropriatly acknowledge the source of the information they are using. This also should including an acknowledgement of volunteer efforts in instances where data were collected by citizen scientist. This project was a collaborative initiative between Birds Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Ducks Unlimited Canada, Pacific Habitat Join Venture, USGS Cooperative Unit, Washing Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Audubon Washington.

In short, surveys have been conducted by volunteers using a standardized protocol and data collection sheets. Shore-based counts are completed monthly on or near the second Sunday of each month from September to April. Surveys are complete within approximately 2 hour of high tide to maximize the opportunity for close observation. All waterbirds observed to a distance of 1 km from the high tide line are counted, except those that fly through without stopping. In the case of larger flocks, numbers are estimated by counting individuals and species in groups and scaling up (see Training Module for Volunteers). Data are entered through a customized online data entry system available on the Birds Canada website, NatureCounts. Observations are processed using the eBird data filters to flag rare species and high counts during observer data entry, and records are manually reviewed for form accuracy. 2.3 Avian Data Collected Observation counts of waterbird and raptor seen during a survey are compiled at the scale of the route (i.e., the maximum count per species) on each monthly survey. These observations are divided into inland, near shore (shoreline to 500m out from high tide), off shore (beyond 500m), and total counts. The dataset is not zero-filled. Taxonomic Authority = eBird/Clements v2019 2.4 Auxiliary Data Collected Observer information: observer ID Survey information: time observation started, time observation ended, duration in hours Survey condition: precipitation, % cloud, sea condition, tide state, tide movement, visibility, survey equipment, human activity (all categorical) 2.5 Data Access, Permission, and Format Data can be freely accessed through the NatureCounts data download portal or directly through the naturecounts R package, which I will demonstrate later in this chapter. The BCCWS is Access Level 4 dataset, meaning a data request form must be submitted. This is not meant to be a barrier, rather a means of keeping track of who is using the data and for what purposes. Data are formatted using a standardized schema that is a core standard of the Avian Knowledge Network and which feeds into GBIF. This format is called the Bird Monitoring Data Exchange (BMDE), which includes 169 core fields for capturing all metric and descriptors associated with bird observations. 2.6 Data Use Considerations The data are collected using a standardize protocol, by trained citizen-science volunteers. This standardization is a strength of this datasets for making inferences about coastal waterbirds in the Canadian Salish Sea. The repeated sampling design of the BCCWS makes this dataset suitable for an occupancy modelling framework, in which the probability of detection can be modeled alongside occupancy. Auxiliary data collected during each survey are suitable for the detection process of the model. Using mean counts in abundance on a route within a year, these data have also been recently used to assess coastal waterbird trends. Measures of effort are innate to the dataset. Survey duration (column DurationinHours) and survey area can be used to make effort correction to counts. Survey areas for each survey route has been provided as a .shp file in the Data folder in this project directory. The number of years an observer has been doing the survey can also be used to correct for observer bias. There is spatial inbalance in the sampling design, with more routes occurring in the southern Salish Sea and around areas that are inhabited by people. Hard to access locations are no well sampled, nor are regions further to the north. Since this survey is shore-based, there will be a species sampling bias. Specifically, birds that use near shore habitats will be detected and counted more often than birds which use offshore habitats. This dataset may therefore be less suitable for modelling at-sea habitat use, for example. The dataset should be filtered prior to use. For example, rare species should be removed since they are not necessarily representative (e.g., those which occur on &lt;1% of routes). Depending on the analysis, routes that are run for only a short time (e.g., &lt;3 years) or which have incomplete data (e.g., &lt;8 months per year or &lt;4 core winter month) may be considered for removal.This dataframe is not zero-filled. It is up to the data user to zero-fill the martix prior to use.

Also note that the year long survey period straddles a calendar year. In short, counts of birds and marine mammals were made from a small boat moving at 10-12 knots within a 200 m (100m on either side) wide transect parallel to the shoreline. Surveyors also recorded the number of birds and mammals seen beyond 100 m of the boat. Two observers scanned for birds and mammals on either side of the boat. One observer calls out waypoints approximately every 250-500 meters (depending on survey year), while the other observer recorded the data. Binoculars are used to assist in counting and identifying distant birds and mammals. In most situations, birds and mammals are counted individually. Flocks of more than about 100 individual birds were estimated by summing the number by groups of 10s of individuals. Technical reports can be found here: The Southern Gulf Islands (2008-2010) Burrard Inlet and Indian Arm (2011-2013) Boundary Bay (2007-2008) (no report available) Howe Sound (2014-2015) The Fraser River Estuary (2016-2017) 3.3 Avian Data Collected Counts of waterbird seen during a survey are compiled for each point along a survey transect (i.e., the maximum species count) on each monthly survey.

Survey duration (column DurationinHours) can be used to make effort correction to counts. Surveys targeted regions of the Canadian Salish Sea that are known to be important to seabirds.

In short, surveys are conducted by volunteers using a standardized protocol and data collection sheets. Shore-based counts are completed monthly on the first Saturday of each month from October to April. Surveys are complete within approximately 2 hour of high tide to maximize the opportunity for close observation. Surveys are a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes per site. All waterbirds observed to a distance of 300 m from the high tide line are counted, except those that fly through without stopping. For large flocks, surveys estimate both the min, max, and best estimate. Surveyors are required to attend a short training session with Seattle Audubon staff prior to their first survey. Data are entered through a customized online data entry system, available here. 5.3 Avian Data Collected Total observation counts of each waterbird species seen during a point survey are recorded for each monthly, including bearing, distance, and sex ratio. Raptors are recorded separately from the other waterbird species. The dataset is not zero-filled. Taxonomic Authority = 5.4 Auxiliary Data Collected Observer information: observer name Survey information: time observation started, time observation ended Survey condition: weather, precipitation, sea state, tide movement, visibility, human activity, raptor activity (all categorical) 5.5 Data Access, Permission, and Format At the time of writing, the data were only accessible by reaching out to the Seattle Audubon directly and filling out a data share agreement. The data will be sent to you as a .xslx flat file which will be suitable for Data Processing. Ensure that you receive all the data for the specified temporal period you are interested in analyzing. This will be needed to allow for proper zero-filling. 5.6 Data Use Considerations The data are collected using a standardize protocol, by trained citizen-science volunteers. This standardization is a strength of this datasets for making inferences about coastal waterbirds in the US Salish Sea. Since surveyors gathers information on distance and direction, estimates of bird density through distance sampling is possible. Specifically, detection of any species declines with the distance from the observer: poor sighting conditions, quality of observing equipment, and observer inexperience all contribute to declining detection likelihood as distance increases. Distance sampling provides a robust approach to estimating density and allow for calculation of less biased density estimates. The repeated sampling design of the PSSS makes this dataset suitable for an occupancy modelling framework, in which the probability of detection can be modeled alongside occupancy. Auxiliary data collected during each survey are suitable for the detection process of the model. Measures of effort are innate to the dataset. Survey duration can be used to make effort correction to counts. There is spatial inbalance in the sampling design? Since this survey is shore-based, there will be a species sampling bias. Specifically, birds that use near shore habitats will be detected and counted more often than birds which use offshore habitats. This dataset may therefore be less suitable for modelling sea bird habitat use, for example.

The surveys were designed to occur during midwinter, when sea ducks and other marine birds are least likely to be migrating. Flights are conducted at an altitude of 200 feet (61 meters) above the water and at an airspeed of 85-90 knots. Each biologist counts all marine bird and mammal observations within a 50-meter strip along their respective side of the aircraft. The surveys cover the entire shoreline of the inland marine waters of Washington. The offshore waters are sampled by flying a pre-designed zigzag pattern. MASS data processing notes can be found online by navigating to the ESRI open data portal. Download the data by clicking the Open button, then save the files to the Data directory in this project. Information on data processing can be found in the Midwinter Aerial Seabird Surveys Geoprocessing Metadata Notes.pdf. In short, during pre-processing the flight crew transcribe voice recordings of their observations, linking them with a series of GPS observation point locations collected during the survey. The results are two tab-delimited text files containing observation and track-log locations. When the surveyors have completed their transcription, a series of geoprocessing scripts are run which omit off-effort observations, calculate the extent of surveyed areas, and add appropriate attribute information to both observations and survey strips. 6.3 Avian Data Collected The PSEMP_Survey_Observations layer stores the processed bird observation data, including total ObservationCount of species on a given transect. There are three additional table which are used to assign species to species codes, scientific names, and groups. Species: This table lists the avian species groups recorded during the winter fixed-wing aerial shorebird surveys. It provides species common and scientific names as well as the species codes (TaxoNameID) necessary to crosswalk these species to group membership (for composite groups analyzed) and to other WDFW databases. PSEMP_Group: This table provides a list of composite groups of species surveys. Some of these groups were included in subsequent statistical analysis; these groups are noted in the “StatsRun” attribute. SpeciesPSEMP_Group: This associative table allows species observations to be crosswalked to composite groups that they participate in. PSEMP_SpeciesObservation_Attribute.xlsx: This is an extra table that was attained from the MASS group directly. It contains descriptors of the PSEMP_Survey_Observations layer. A copy of this table is saved in the Data director. Taxonomic Authority - AOU with modifications 6.4 Auxiliary Data Collected Each observation point contains detailed attribute information including date, time, TransectID, ObserverID, and environmental characteristics (i.e., wind, glare). The MidwinterAerialSeaBirdSurvey.gdb also contains a PSEMP_Analysis_Strata polygon file that contains the spatial extent and boundaries of the basin-depth strata. There are nine basins and six depth classes identified. 6.5 Data Access, Permission, and Format Data are accessible online by navigating to the ESRI open data portal. Download the data by clicking the Open button. The data are in a geodatabase (.gdb), which is a proprietary format of ESRI meaning the data are not suited for exchange with other applications. Urg. My suggestion is that you import the data layers into ArcGIS, and export the PSEMP_SurveyObservations and Species tables as .txt files for import into Excel. Then they can be opened and saved as .csv files for processing in the Data directory of this project. Although the data are openly available, WDFW staff ask you develop a data-sharing agreement prior to analysis and publication. 6.6 Data Use Considerations Before using the information, please consult Joseph.Evenson@dfw.wa.gov or Kyle.Spragens@dfw.wa.gov. Appropriate use of the data or analysis requires a detailed understanding of the survey effort and how that effort has changed over time. Not accounting for these details are very likely to result in inappropriate interpretation.

There are three main data collection protocols, including: Stationary: objective is birding, a single fixed location, with specified start and end time Travelling: objective is birding, specified start and end time, and known distance of travel Incidental: objective is not on birding, but species was identified and submitted. Not a complete checklist. There are also several specialized protocols: Pelagic: applies to checklists that are made farther than two miles offshore on oceans, seas, or large lakes. These data are likely most valuable to this initiative. Banding: birds observed because they were captured for banding. Detection rates from banding are very different from normal birding Nocturnal Flight Call (NFC): nighttime contact calls of migrating songbirds as they pass through on their way to breeding grounds 7.3 Avian Data Collected eBird data are collected and organized around the concept of a checklist, representing observations from a single birding event, such as a 1 km walk through a park or 15 minutes observing bird feeders in a backyard. Each checklist contains a list of species observed and the counts of the number of individuals seen of each species.

For all downloads and APIs, eBird require first that you submit a request with a short abstract so they can learn more about how eBird data are being used. eBird date requests can be made to Cornell here. There is also an option to request eBird Canada data through the NatureCounts platform by making a request here. However, for the purposes of this transboundary project, the data example will be using eBird data accessed through Cornell. eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) is the core dataset for accessing all raw eBird observations and associated metadata.There are several R packages available for summarizing data, including one that is managed by the Cornell Lab specifically for working with the EBD dataset: auk: eBird Data Extraction and Processing with AWK. eBird Observational Dataset (EOD) is made available through GBIF and includes species, date, and location. Additional metadata associated with these observations, including sampling event data (i.e., effort), are not included through this platform. eBird’s Terms of Use are clearly outlined on their webpage, and should be reviewed prior to requesting data. eBird data are not zero-filled. Instructions on zero-filling the dataset can be found here. Additional information on the metadata strucutre can be found in the “eBird Basic Dataset Metadata (v1.14)” pdf, which is saved in the Data folder of this directory. 7.6 Data Use Considerations eBird is a semi-structured project, having flexible, easy to follow protocols that attract many participants, making it the largest avian citizen science dataset globally. However, despite the strengths of eBird’s size, species observations collected through citizen science projects present a number of challenges that are not found in conventional scientific data. The following are some of the primary challenges associated these data: taxonomic, spatial, and temporal biases, spatial precision, class inbalance, and variation in detection. When working with semi-structured datasets like eBird, one approach to dealing with this variation is to impose some more consistent structure on the data by filtering observations on the effort variables. This reduces the variation in detectability between checklists. It is generally recommended that users restricting checklists to less than 5 hours long and 5 km in length, and with 10 or fewer observers. Users of eBird data should review and adopt Best Practices for Using eBird Data. Recommended Citation: eBird Basic Dataset. Version: EBD_relSep-2022. Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York.

Participants join groups that survey sub-units of the circle during the course of the day using a variety of transportation methods (mostly on foot, in a car, or watching at a feeder, but can include boat, ski, or snowmobile). All birds seen or heard are recorded. Data compilers for each circle collect and submit data to Audubon. 8.3 Avian Data Collected All birds are counted all day, giving an indication of the total number of birds in the circle that day.

Larger data subsets of raw data may be provided for analytical use. To request permission, contact Audubon at cbcadmin@audubon.org. A online form will be send to you to complete. When requesting data from Audubon, keep in mind that you do not need all the available data. You should make a request that matched the spatial and temporal extend of the study to limit the file size. For example, my request included Washington State and British Columbia, and the years 1990-current. You will also be able to specify the data tables you require. In this instance, request all the available data tables (i.e., counts, effort, weather, and lat/longs). You must credit Audubon and the volunteers who collected the data in all published material containing CBC data, including scientific papers, articles, adverts, talks and slides with the following: “CBC Data are provided by National Audubon Society and through the generous efforts of Bird Studies Canada and countless volunteers across the Western Hemisphere.” Where possible, you should provide a link to the Audubon and CBC websites and, when using CBC data collected in Canada, Birds Canada, Audubon’s Canadian CBC partner. Please review the CBC data use policy prior to requesting data. 8.6 Data Use Considerations The Christmas Bird Count has undoubted value for documenting broad patterns of change in winter distribution (both annual and long-term) and for studies of patterns in species richness. No other data set provides such broad temporal and geographic coverage of North America’s winter bird life! However, like other citizen-science programs, there are several date use considerations to keep in mind. Although the number of uncommon species detected on a given count is certain to increase with effort, rare species are often scouted ahead of time, and the emphasis that most participants put on high species totals ensures that the distributional, presence–absence data in the CBC are very good. Counts within and between circles can vary because of sampling biases, including number of participants, hours in the field, extent and modes of travel, cover-age of different habitats, skill levels, and use of attractive devices (e.g. bird feeders, noises such as “pishing”). Some of these biases can be accounted for in an analysis if the necessariy data are recorded. For example, survey effort has changes over the years. In recent decades, the number of party-hours has been recorded to account for the variable duration of, and participation in, the count. Thus, party-hour is often considered as an effort covariate in model development. Spatial distribution of count circles is not random. Like many citizen science programs, count sites were originally placed near population centers. This spatial bias towards urban center still persists. Finally, CBC is a land-based survey. The focus of data collection is therefore not on coastal waterbirds or seabirds.

It is the responsibility of the data user to understand the various data collection protocols, stipulations around data access, and data use considerations. Start by loading the packages needed for this chapter #install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) #remotes::install_github(&quot;BirdsCanada/naturecounts&quot;) library(naturecounts) library(tidyverse) library(stringr) library(auk) 9.1 Data Schema The purpose of this chapter is to provide the data user R script which will enable the compilation of disparate avian data sources into a standardized format (also known as a schema). The format selected for the purposes of this project was the Bird Monitoring Data Exchange (BMDE), which is the core standard of NatureCounts a node of the Avian Knowledge Network. The BMDE includes 169 core fields for capturing all metric and descriptors associated with bird observations. You can use the naturecounts R package and the following scripts to view the BMDE core fields. A copy of the BMDE table is also in the BMDE folder of this directory, which provides additional descriptions of the core columns. BMDE&lt;-meta_bmde_fields(&quot;core&quot;) Any data owners wishing to contribute their data to the NatureCounts database should complete the metadata form, also found in the BMDE folder, and reach out to Catherine Jardin: cjardine@birdscanada.org, Birds Canada’s Data Analyst. 9.2 Species Codes A crucial steps to combining datasets is the inclusion of a common species code. Let’s compile the complete species list now for use later in the data compilation. The data tables you will need can be accessed using the naturecounts R package. sp.code&lt;-meta_species_codes() sp.code&lt;-sp.code %&gt;% filter(authority==&quot;BSCDATA&quot;) %&gt;% select(-authority, -species_id2, -rank) %&gt;% distinct() sp.tax&lt;-meta_species_taxonomy() sp.tax&lt;-sp.tax %&gt;% select(species_id, scientific_name, english_name) %&gt;% distinct() sp&lt;-left_join(sp.code, sp.tax, by=&quot;species_id&quot;) sp&lt;-sp %&gt;% distinct(english_name, .keep_all = TRUE) 9.3 Data Manipulation All data sets need to be manipulated before they are used for an analysis. Anyone that uses big datasets for research will tell you that it often takes more time to manipulate and filter the data than doing the actual statistical analysis. I therefore cannot cover all the possible data manipulations you will do, but will give you some sample script to help compile a complete dataset. To accommodate the R scripts in this chapter, data samples for each dataset are provided in the Data folder. These samples are structured in the same format you will receive the raw data from the data owner. 9.3.1 BCCWS &amp; BCMA We start with two Canadian datasets that are already in the BMDE schema and accessoble through NatureCounts. The BCCWS and BCMA are accessible through the NatureCounts webportal or directly using the naturecounts R package. Since the BCCWS is Access Level 3, you need to make a data request. Once your NatureCounts data request is approved you will receive an email confirmation, which will contain your request_id. This number will be used to download your newly acquired dataset into R. The BCMA is open access, Level 5, and therefore a data request_id is not required. If you are new to the naturecounts R package, I recommend you start by reviewing the Introductory R Tutorial.

&quot; PSSS&lt;-PSSS[BMDE_col] 9.3.4 MASS The data will be downloaded as a .gdb file, which is a proprietary format of ESRI meaning the data are not suited for exchange with other applications. My suggestion is that you (or your GIS analyst) import the data layers into ArcGIS, and export tables in .txt. format for import into Excel. Then save as .csv in the Data directory of this project. The tables provided will include: PSEMP_Survey_Observations (PSEMP_sample.csv): This is a point layer storing processed bird observation data recorded during the winter fixed-wing aerial shorebird surveys. There are two observers in the plane, one on each side facing outward, that record their observations into an audio recording device along with timestamp information and position data from an on-board GPS receiver. This data is later transcribed into tab-delimited files along with a timestamped track-log for the plane (also tab-delimited). This source data are then imported into GIS format and a series of geoprocessing scripts are run which project these points spatially 63 meters at right angles to either side of the plane as well as filtering them (to reduce the chance of double counting) and adding additional attribute information. You will want to add the X and Y coordinates to this table before you export it from ArcGIS. If you are not familiar with how to do this, you will find some useful instructions here. PSEMP_SurveyRoutes: This is a polyline GIS data layer representing the flight path of the fixed wing plane recorded (initially as a series of point locations) during the winter fixed-wing aerial shorebird surveys. PSEMP_SurveyArea: This is a polygon data layer that represents the area considered to be visually surveyed during the annual winter fixed-wing aerial shorebird surveys. The data consist of rectangular strips that run parallel to the flight path of the plane. The strips are 50 meters wide and are centered 63 meters to either side of the plane. Locations of shorebird observations recorded along the flight path are spatially projected into the center of these strips. The purpose of the strips is to provide an estimate of surveyed area as well as serving as inputs in a process wherein some shorebird observations are removed from areas of survey strip overlap in an effort to minimize the chances of double counting birds. Species (PSEMP_species.csv): This table lists the avian species groups recorded during the winter fixed-wing aerial shorebird surveys. It provides species common and scientific names as well as the species codes (TaxoNameID) necessary to crosswalk these species to group membership (for composite groups analyzed) and to other WDFW databases. PSEMP_Group: This table provides a list of composite groups of species surveys. Some of these groups were included in subsequent statistical analysis; these groups are noted in the “StatsRun” attribute. SpeciesPSEMP_Group: This associative table allows species observations to be crosswalked to composite groups that they participate in. PSEMP_SpeciesObservation_Attribute.xlsx: This is an extra table that was attained from the MASS group directly. It contains descriptors of the PSEMP_Survey_Observations layer. A copy of this table is saved in the Data director. We will work with the sample dataset here which has the same formatting as the full dataset that you will receive through the online download.

In this instance, I would request all the data for Washington and British Columbia from 2002-2022. Each region needs to be requested separately. Once you have received the raw data files, you can save them in the Data directory of this folder. They will be BIG! Due to the large size of this dataset, it must be filtered to a smaller subset of desired observations before reading into R. This filtering is most efficiently done using auk: eBird Data Extraction and Processing with AWK. a Unix utility and programming language for processing column formatted text data. This package acts as a front end for AWK, allowing users to filter eBird data before import into R. There will be several files in the .zip folder along with your raw data, including: BCRCodes, IBACodes, USFWSCodes, recommend citation, terms of use, and the metadata file. We will once again work with the sample dataset here which has the same formatting as the full dataset that you will receive through the online download. #start by setting the working directory of the abd files to the data directory of this project, where your datafiles should be saved #getwd() # your curent working directory #auk_set_ebd_path(&quot;C:/Users/dethier/Documents/ethier-scripts/DataCompile-SDJV/Data/&quot;, overwrite=FALSE) WA_in&lt;-&quot;Data/eBirdWA_sample.txt&quot; WA_out&lt;-&quot;Data/WA_filter.txt&quot; ebird_WA&lt;-WA_in %&gt;% auk_ebd() %&gt;% #define filters auk_bcr(bcr=5) %&gt;% auk_protocol(&quot;eBird Pelagic Protocol&quot;) %&gt;% auk_filter(file=WA_out) %&gt;% read_ebd() BC_in&lt;-&quot;Data/eBirdBC_sample.txt&quot; BC_out&lt;-&quot;Data/BC_filter.txt&quot; ebird_BC&lt;-BC_in %&gt;% auk_ebd() %&gt;% #define filters auk_bcr(bcr=5) %&gt;% auk_protocol(&quot;eBird Pelagic Protocol&quot;) %&gt;% auk_filter(file=BC_out) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% read_ebd() ebird_data&lt;-rbind(ebird_BC, ebird_WA) #separate data and time columns ebird_data&lt;-ebird_data %&gt;% separate(observation_date, into=c(&quot;YearCollected&quot;, &quot;MonthCollected&quot;, &quot;DayCollected&quot;), sep=&quot;-&quot;) #rename columns ebird_data&lt;-ebird_data %&gt;% dplyr::rename (GlobalUniqueIdentifier=global_unique_identifier, DateLastModified=last_edited_date, TaxonConceptID=taxon_concept_id, CommonName=common_name, ScientificName=scientific_name, ObservationCount=observation_count, Country=country_code, StateProvince=state, SurveyAreaIdentifier=locality_id, TimeCollected=time_observations_started, CollectorNumber=observer_id, SamplingEventIdentifier=sampling_event_identifier, ProtocolType=protocol_type, ProtocolCode=protocol_code, ProjectCode=project_code, DistanceFromStart=effort_distance_km, SurveyAreaSize=effort_area_ha, NumberOfObservers=number_observers, AllIndividualsReported=all_species_reported, Remarks=trip_comments, Remarks2=species_comments, DecimalLatitude= latitude, DecimalLongitude=longitude, Locality=locality ) ebird_data$BasisOfRecord &lt;- &quot;Observation&quot; ebird_data$CollectionCode &lt;- &quot;EBIRD&quot; ebird_data$Continent &lt;-&quot;North America&quot; ebird_data$ProtocolURL&lt;- &quot;https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols&quot; ebird_data&lt;-ebird_data %&gt;% mutate(DurationInHours = duration_minutes/60) #Now that we have specified all the data columns we can, we will create the BMDE standardized data table. #Identify the missing columns of data BMDE_col&lt;-unique(BMDE$local_name) missing&lt;-setdiff(BMDE_col, names(ebird_data)) ebird_data[missing]&lt;-&quot; &quot; ebird_data&lt;-ebird_data[BMDE_col] 9.3.6 CBC To access CBC data you must contact Audubon at cbcadmin@audubon.org. A online form will be send to you to complete. When completing this form, scope the data to the geographic and temporal scale you require. You will also be asked if you want the auxiliary data included, such as effor and weather. Select yes to all options so that you have a complete dataset to work with. You will receive the raw data compressed in a Box folder, which you can download and save to the Data directory associated with this project. You will also be given links to download the “cbc_field_definitions_2013.pdf”, which details the information in each data column, and the “CBCEditorialCodes.pdf”, which defines the modifiers used when recording species. Both of these files are saved in the Data directory of this project. The tables provided will include: Circle_Species_Report: the raw counts of each species seen in each circle in each year Effort_Many_Types: for each count circle in each year, this table details the mode of data collection (e.g., car, foot), distance traveled, and the number of hours the survey took. Effort_Summary_Report: for each count in each year, this table details additional types of data collection effort, including field versus feeder counters, min and max parties, feeder hours, noctural hours, and nocutural distance. These data are often used for effort correction. Weather_Report: for each count circle in each year, this table details all th weather covarites collectd during the survey. Count_History_Report: this table detail when each count circle was run and in which years. This can be used to zero-fill the data martix. We will once again work with the sample dataset here which has the same formatting as the full dataset that you will receive through the online download. 9.4 Zero-filling dataframe 9.5 Assigning survey period Winter surveys more than often straddle two calendar years (e.g., start in October 2021 and end in April 2022). When doing an analysis you are often interested in ‘year’ as a covarite or random effect. We will call this data column survey Period. NOTE: The MASS dataset contains the SurveyYear which is the end year of the survey period. We removed this during data processing but will add it back here. 9.6 Remove rare or non-representative species Spatial Data Place Holder "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
