## Data Collection Protocol {#CBC8.2}

Winter bird are counted on a single calendar day between December 14--January 5. Count volunteers follow specified routes through a designated 15-mile (24-km) diameter circle, counting every bird they see or hear all day. Participants join groups that survey sub-units of the circle during the course of the day using a variety of transportation methods (mostly on foot, in a car, or watching at a feeder, but can include boat, ski, or snowmobile). All birds seen or heard are recorded. Data compilers for each circle collect and submit data to Audubon.

## Avian Data Collected {#CBC8.3}

All birds are counted all day, giving an indication of the total number of birds in the circle that day. CBC data are entered online through a program-specific [webportal](https://netapp.audubon.org/aap/application/cbc). Data can also be submitted using the [eBird mobile app](https://ebird.org/news/ebirding-your-christmas-bird-count-updated).

## Auxiliary Data Collected {#CBC8.4}

-   Observer information: number of individuals participating including the compilers ID

-   Survey information: duration of counts, number of party-hours, types of counts (e.g., road, walk), and distance travelled

-   Weather information: temperature, wind, snow, cloud, rain

## Data Access, Permission, and Format {#CBC8.5}

Christmas Bird Count (CBC) is a National Audubon Society owned and operated citizen science and research program and database. The CBC Database is housed on Audubon-owned servers and is accessible only through the Audubon web portal. *Terms of Use* govern access to and use of the CBC Database. Please read these terms carefully. By accessing the CBC Database, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by Audubon's policy [Privacy Policy](https://www.audubon.org/privacy-policy). Larger data subsets of raw data may be provided for analytical use. To request permission, contact Audubon at [cbcadmin\@audubon.org](mailto:cbcadmin@audubon.org){.email}. A online form will be send to you to complete.

When requesting data from Audubon, keep in mind that you do not need all the available data. You should make a request that matched the spatial and temporal extend of the study to limit the file size. For example, my request included Washington State and British Columbia, and the years 1990-current. You will also be able to specify the data tables you require. In this instance, request all the available data tables (i.e., counts, effort, weather, and lat/longs).

You must credit Audubon and the volunteers who collected the data in all published material containing CBC data, including scientific papers, articles, adverts, talks and slides with the following: "CBC Data are provided by National Audubon Society and through the generous efforts of Bird Studies Canada and countless volunteers across the Western Hemisphere." Where possible, you should provide a link to the Audubon and CBC websites and, when using CBC data collected in Canada, Birds Canada, Audubon's Canadian CBC partner.

Please review the [CBC data use policy](https://www.audubon.org/content/policy-regarding-use-christmas-bird-count-data) prior to requesting data.

## Data Use Considerations {#CBC8.6}

The Christmas Bird Count has undoubted value for documenting broad patterns of change in winter distribution (both annual and long-term) and for studies of patterns in species richness. No other data set provides such broad temporal and geographic coverage of North America's winter bird life! However, like other citizen-science programs, there are several date use considerations to keep in mind.

Although the number of uncommon species detected on a given count is certain to increase with effort, rare species are often scouted ahead of time, and the emphasis that most participants put on high species totals ensures that the distributional, presence--absence data in the CBC are very good.

Counts within and between circles can vary because of sampling biases, including number of participants, hours in the field, extent and modes of travel, cover-age of different habitats, skill levels, and use of attractive devices (e.g. bird feeders, noises such as "pishing"). Some of these biases can be accounted for in an analysis if the necessariy data are recorded. For example, survey effort has changes over the years. In recent decades, the number of party-hours has been recorded to account for the variable duration of, and participation in, the count. Thus, party-hour is often considered as an effort covariate in model development.

Spatial distribution of count circles is not random. Like many citizen science programs, count sites were originally placed near population centers. This spatial bias towards urban center still persists.

Finally, CBC is a land-based survey. The focus of data collection is therefore not on coastal waterbirds or seabirds.
