## Data Collection Protocol {#CBC8.2}

Winter bird are counted on a single calendar day between December 14â€“January 5. Count volunteers follow specified routes through a designated 15-mile (24-km) diameter circle, counting every bird they see or hear all day. Participants join groups that survey sub-units of the circle during the course of the day using a variety of transportation methods (mostly on foot, in a car, or watching at a feeder, but can include boat, ski, or snowmobile). All birds seen or heard are recorded. Data compilers for each circle collect and submit data to Audubon. 


## Avian Data Collected {#CBC8.3}

All birds are counted all day, giving an indication of the total number of birds in the circle that day. CBC data are entered online through a program-specific [webportal](https://netapp.audubon.org/aap/application/cbc). Data can also be submitted using the [eBird mobile app](https://ebird.org/news/ebirding-your-christmas-bird-count-updated). 

## Auxiliary Data Collected {#CBC8.4}

-   Observer information: number of individuals participating 

-   Survey Information: duration of counts, number of party-hours
